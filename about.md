# Another Exercise
This exercise was to create a new page, about.md then add a link to [index.md](https://lawtlee.github.io/github-sites-test/)

This will be crazy especially when you see that you visited this page at the link: https://lawtlee.github.io/github-sites-test/about.html\
The interesting part of this is that this was created using Jekyll which converts mardown files into html files.
