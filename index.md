# Building Websites in github

## Section 2
This is part of another exercise in the carpentries workshop.\
This time I'm going to be adding a code block because i think that's cool

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namepsace std;
int main() {
  int y = some_MACRO_Reference;
int x= 5 + 6;
cout << "Hello World!" << x << endl;
}
```
